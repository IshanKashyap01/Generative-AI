# Prompt Engineering

- It is the process of designing inputs for genAI models that provides the most
accurate and optimal answers

- To do so, we need to have the following in our queries:

  - Background information about the problem required to understand the situation

  - Clear and as descriptive as possible explanation of the problem

  - Any restrictions or parameters that need to be fulfilled by the answer

- For example, if we need the AI model to write a piece of code for our project,
we will give it the following information:

  - The technologies, techniques and languages used in the project

  - The functional and non-functional requirements expected from the answer

  - The language, framework, and APIs the AI should use to write the answer

- We can also ask for alternative solutions and other tweaks to its solution based
on our needs
